# Finding-optimal-unsupervised-method-to-classify-infared-spectra-of-pure-and-adulterated-puree

This is a demonstration of choosing between Support Vector Machines, Boosting and Bagging for accurate classification of f 983 mid-infrared (MIR) spectra collected from different authenticated fruit purees. The purees are either obtained from pure strawberry, or from adulterated strawberries and/or other black and red colored fruits. The sample spectra are thus assigned to one of two classes: strawberry (purees prepared from fresh whole strawberries) and nonstrawberry (diverse collection of other purees, including strawberry adulterated with other fruits and sugar solutions, raspberry, apple, blackcurrant, blackberry, plum, cherry, apricot, grape juice and mixtures of these). The spectra were acquired from each puree using attenuated total reflectance sampling, with the acquisition order randomized with respect to the sample type. The spectra are measured over 47 wavelenghts.

We investigate which of the approaches to classification are most effective using training and validation sets. Then we construct a tuned model of the optimal method which can be used to classify new unseen observations.
